Project Description
We used the Morgan fingerprint approach and two NPL-based embedding models to predict Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSPs). Five combinations of molecular representations and machine learning methods are provided here: Morgan fingerprints with XGBoost, Mol2Vec embeddings using XGBoost and FFNN, respectively and the two ChemBERTa finetuned models. Each of them has been applied to d, h, and p and as a benchmark, the ESOL aqueous solubility parameters.
